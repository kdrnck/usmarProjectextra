An e-comm/delivery application for grocery shopping in BahÃ§ekÃ¶y (my town)

This is my first project with deadline. I gave myself 21 days in May 13th. But after 10-12 days, in 25th of May I was done with this project.
I was actually thinking making this one real and operate it couple months in my summer vacation. I come to an agreement with a local grocery that gives me 12% of everything I sold. But in brief time I mailed with a big start up in my country called Getir*. They replied me and I presented them the storage of that local grocery which called Usmar. We turned the place to the Getir storage location and make them operate in my area. I earned 5000 Turkish Liras with this. Well this is not a big money compared to the ones in Valley, 5000TL is nearly 580$, but at the end first agreement and money with developing.. I mean software... Software company. Getir is a software company right?

Whatever.. I was surfing online and uploading the project to the GitHub popped in my mind. I will upload my old and new projects soon. This must be proudly sit here, at the front page of my GitHub profile ðŸ˜Ž
